# Daily Reflection

A small personal reflection web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was built during my first year of engineering while learning JavaScript DOM manipulation and events. The goal was to apply what I had learned by building a simple, usable project instead of following tutorials step by step.

## Live Demo

Live app: https://daily-reflection-inky.vercel.app
(Deployed using Vercel)

---

## Project motivation

After completing the basics of JavaScript, especially DOM selection and event handling, I wanted to build something on my own to test my understanding.

I chose a reflection-based app because it is simple, personal, and allowed me to focus on JavaScript fundamentals without adding unnecessary complexity.

---

## What the app does

- Add daily reflection entries
- Edit and delete existing entries
- Store data locally in the browser
- Toggle between dark and light mode
- Export reflections as a text file
- Show a simple overall summary (number of entries and dates)

---

## My contribution

- HTML: written completely by me  
- JavaScript: written by me while learning DOM and events. I used online coding platforms, documentation, and developer tools mainly to debug errors and understand issues
- CSS: basic CSS written by me while learning fundamentals. Some styling ideas were inspired by AI tools and other online references. I understand the CSS used and can analyze or modify it if required.

## What I learned from this project

Building this project helped me:

- Understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM
- Work with event listeners and user input
- Manage application state using localStorage
- Debug issues by reading errors and testing edge cases
- Write cleaner and more readable beginner-level code
- Make basic UI and UX decisions independently

---

## Learning context

- Built during first year
- JavaScript level at the time:
  - Basics of JavaScript
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Browser storage (localStorage)
- No frameworks or external libraries used

I am continuing to learn JavaScript in more depth and plan to build more projects as I progress.

---

## Experience gained

This project gave me confidence to:

- Start projects without relying completely on tutorials
- Break problems into smaller steps
- Debug my own code instead of rewriting everything
- Understand the importance of simplicity and clarity in early projects

---

## Notes

This repository represents my learning stage at the time it was built.  
The focus was on understanding core concepts, not building a production-ready application.

---

## Future plans

- Learn deeper and advanced JavaScript concepts
- Improve code structure as my understanding grows
- Build more projects with increasing complexity


##Final note
-This project is intentionally simple.
-Keeping it this way makes it honest, explainable, and a good representation of my current learning stage.
